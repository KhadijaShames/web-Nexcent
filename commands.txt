First , i opened the search and wrote: git cmd

#cd downloads => is used to change the current directory to a folder named "downloads"

#git --v => to make sure it exists and what its version are

#git status => to know the condition he is in now

#mkdir libanux-website => to create a folder

#cd web-Nexcent => we have entered the file

#git init => the command git init converts any regular folder into a Git project

#notepad README.md => you can create a file and open it in Notepad to write or add whatever you want inside ( searched for something similar to nano but for Windows, i could also create it using the touch command)

#notepad index.html => i created another file 

#git add . => this will add the files in the current directory(and subdirectories) to the staging area

#git commit -m "chore: initial website structure with README and index.html" => to commit the changes you've added to the staging area with the message description

#git remote add origin https://github.com/KhadijaShames/web-Nexcent.git => the command is used to link your local Git repository to a remote repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)

#git branch -M main => renamed the current branch to main

#git push -u origin main => used when you want to push to the main branch on GitHub for the first time.

#notepad commands.txt => created a file named commands.txt in Notepad 

#mkdir pages styles assets scripts => this command creates four directories (folders): pages, styles, assets. These are used to organize the project structure.
pages: Will hold the HTML files
styles: Will contain the CSS files
assets: Will store images, fonts, and other static assets

#cd styles => this changes the current directory to the styles folder

#notepad styles.css => this opens Notepad and creates the styles.css file inside the styles directory

#cd .. => this takes you back to the parent directory

#cd assets => this changes the current directory to the assets folder

#mkdir images => this creates a folder named images inside the assets folder to store image files
i added images to the images folder within the assets folder

#cd .. => this takes you back to the parent directory

#code . => this opens the current directory in Visual Studio Code. If you're using VS Code, this command launches the editor to work on your files

#git add . => this stages all the changes made (i.e., the files and folders you created or modified) in the current directory and subdirectories, preparing them to be committed

#git push origin main => pushed the changes, including the new image, to the main branch on GitHub

#git add commands.txt => added the commands.txt file to be tracked by Git

#git commit -m "docs: add commands.txt with Git command history" => Committed the addition of the commands.txt file with a comment describing its content (Git command history)

#git push origin main => pushed the commands.txt file update to the main branch on GitHub

#git commit -m "feat: update website structure with pages, styles, and images" => this commits the staged changes with the message "feat: update website structure with pages, styles, and images". It describes the changes 
you made to the website structure, such as adding new pages, styles, and assets (like logos)

#git pull origin main --no-edit => this pulls the latest changes from the main branch on GitHub, and merges them into your local repository without changing the commit message 
(since you're using the --no-edit option). This is helpful if someone else has pushed changes to the repository that you need to integrate into your local version

#git push origin main => this pushes your local changes (committed files) to the main branch on the remote GitHub repository
